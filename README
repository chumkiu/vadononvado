This project allows people to announce if they are going to attend a meeting or not. The aims are it to be:
- hassle free (no signup needed)
- modern (openID auth for admins)
- with minimum dependencies
- fairly accurate in predictions


The page will always show the next planned event (for LUGBZ that's next tuesday at 20:00) and the number of people foreseen(*).
Anyone will be able to choose whether s/he will attend the event (possibly using html5 local storage to avoid bots without requesting sign up?)
After the event an admin (that should be authenticated) will confirm the actual number of people attending the meeting. (*) The system will use this info to predict the number of people attending future events.

That's all for now :-)
